If such cancellation, termination, modification or suspension occurs, notification may be posted on the Site.<br /><br />The failure of HTFS to comply with any provision of these Terms due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities outside of the control of HTFS (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Terms.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Publicity</strong><br />By entering a contest, you consent to HashTag Fantasy Sport's, its service providers' and business partners' use of your name, voice, likeness, location and photograph in connection with the development, production, distribution and/or exploitation (including marketing and promotion) of the selected contest and/or other HTFS contests and HTFS generally, unless otherwise prohibited by law.
