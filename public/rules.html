<h1>Game Information & Rules</h1>
<h3>How the Game is Played</h3>
<p>Players must be present at a Host Site to gain access to their game card in the HashTag Fantasy Sports app. Players select athletes from teams playing live matchups during a set time period, typically Sunday afternoon. Currently, HashTag Fantasy Sports is designed for American Football and the three categories include, "Throwing Touchdowns", "All Purpose Yards", and "Receptions". Each category has three threshold levels. Players select athletes they believe will achieve each of those thresholds in each of those categories. If an athlete meets or exceeds the threshold the player receives a set number of points. The player with the most points at the end of the live matchups included in the afternoon game wins.
